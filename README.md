In this project, I had the goal of creating a remote controlled device to power a multi terrain rover. 
The system works by adjusting the Y values on two different joysticks which control the motors (connection to wheels) on either side
This is all done through the use of analog write which allows the joystick to vary the speeds at which the motors run. 
The remote control is powered from the Nrfl0124 which has up to 1000 meters of range and works very well.
